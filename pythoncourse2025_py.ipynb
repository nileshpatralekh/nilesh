        "Bad pivot selection (e.g., always picking the smallest or largest element).\n",

        "1. Introduction to String Processing\n",
        "Reading and writing files often involves processing strings.\n",
        "Python provides built-in string functions that help in:\n",
        "Searching for text\n",
        "Modifying text\n",
        "Extracting data from structured formats (e.g., CSV files)\n",
        "A common use case is extracting values from a text-based spreadsheet (CSV format).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Removing Whitespace from Strings\n",
        "Python provides three functions to remove whitespace:\n",
        "\n",
        "rstrip() → Removes trailing spaces.\n",
        "lstrip() → Removes leading spaces.\n",
        "strip() → Removes spaces from both sides.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "s = \"   \\tHello\\t  \"  # String with leading/trailing spaces and a tab\n",
        "print(s.rstrip())  # \"   \\tHello\"\n",
        "print(s.lstrip())  # \"Hello\\t  \"\n",
        "print(s.strip())   # \"Hello\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Searching for Text in Strings\n",
        "Python provides two functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "find(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.\n",
        "index(): Same as find(), but raises an error if the substring is not found.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "s = \"brown fox grey dog brown fox\"\n",
        "print(s.find(\"brown\"))  # Output: 0 (first occurrence)\n",
        "print(s.find(\"brown\", 5))  # Output: 19 (search from index 5)\n",
        "print(s.find(\"cat\"))  # Output: -1 (not found)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using index() instead of find()\n",
        "print(s.index(\"brown\"))  # Output: 0\n",
        "print(s.index(\"cat\"))  # Raises ValueError (not found)\n",
        " find() returns -1 if not found, while index() raises an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Searching and Replacing Substrings\n",
        "The replace() function replaces occurrences of a substring with another string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "string.replace(old, new, count)\n",
        "old → Substring to replace\n",
        "new → Replacement string\n",
        "count → (Optional) Number of times to replace\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "s = \"brown fox grey dog brown fox\"\n",
        "print(s.replace(\"brown\", \"black\"))  \n",
        "# Output: \"black fox grey dog black fox\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(s.replace(\"brown\", \"black\", 1))  \n",
        "# Output: \"black fox grey dog brown fox\"\n",
        " The count parameter limits the number of replacements.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Overlapping Substring Issue in replace()\n",
        "Consider the string \"abaaba\" and replacing \"aba\" with \"DD\":\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "s = \"abaaba\"\n",
        "print(s.replace(\"aba\", \"DD\"))  \n",
        "# Output: \"DDba\"\n",
        "It does NOT replace both occurrences because after replacing the first \"aba\", the second \"aba\" is modified.\n",
        " Replace works sequentially, so overlapping substrings may not all be replaced.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Splitting Strings (split())\n",
        "Used to split strings into a list based on a delimiter (e.g., ,, :).\n",
        "Useful for parsing structured data like CSV files.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "csv_line = \"6,7,8\"\n",
        "columns = csv_line.split(\",\")  \n",
        "print(columns)  # Output: ['6', '7', '8']\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting list contains substrings extracted from the original string.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Controlling the Number of Splits\n",
        "We can limit the number of splits using an optional argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "Edit\n",
        "s = \"6,7,8,9\"\n",
        "print(s.split(\",\", 2))  \n",
        "# Output: ['6', '7', '8,9']\n",
        "Only the first two commas are used for splitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Using Custom Delimiters\n",
        "We can split using any substring, not just single characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "s = \"6#?7#?8\"\n",
        "print(s.split(\"#?\"))  \n",
        "# Output: ['6', '7', '8']\n",
        "Any fixed substring can be used as a delimiter.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Joining Strings (join())\n",
        "The inverse of split() → Joins a list of strings into a single string.\n",
        "We specify a separator to insert between the list items.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "columns = ['6', '7', '8']\n",
        "csv_line = \",\".join(columns)\n",
        "print(csv_line)  \n",

        "A grid consists of roads arranged in a rectangular format.\n",
        "We start at (0,0) (bottom-left) and need to reach (m, n) (top-right).\n",
        "Allowed Moves: We can only move right or move up (one-way roads).\n",
        "The goal is to count the number of different paths from (0,0) to (m,n).\n",
